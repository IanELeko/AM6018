Including quadratic terms in the training of a RC produces a “square readout matrix” that breaks the symmetry to quell the influence of “mirror-attractors,” which are inverted copies of the RC’s solutions in state space. In this paper, we prove analytically that certain symmetries in the training data forbid the square readout matrix to exist. These analytical results are explored numerically from the perspective of “multifunctionality,” by training the RC to specifically reconstruct a coexistence of the Lorenz attractor and its mirror-attractor. We demonstrate that the square readout matrix emerges when the position of one attractor is slightly altered, even if there are overlapping regions between the attractors or if there is a second pair of attractors. We also find that at large spectral radius values of the RC’s internal connections, the square readout matrix reappears prior to the RC crossing the edge of chaos.","date":"2021-07","libraryCatalog":"aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0055699","accessDate":"2022-05-21T12:59:00Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"31","pages":"073122","publicationTitle":"Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science","DOI":"10.1063/5.0055699","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos","ISSN":"1054-1500","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Flynn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joschka","lastName":"Herteux","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vassilios A.","lastName":"Tsachouridis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Räth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Amann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JVIPERLB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-21T12:59:00Z","dateModified":"2022-05-21T12:59:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/9513611/items/PKNJQZUD","itemID":1,"attachments":[{"key":"97K6PU5V","version":26,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0055699","accessDate":"2022-05-21T12:59:02Z","parentItem":"PKNJQZUD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Flynn et al. - 2021 - Symmetry kills the square in a multifunctional res.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-21T12:59:02Z","dateModified":"2022-05-21T12:59:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/9513611/items/97K6PU5V","localPath":"C:\\Users\\lekoi\\Documents\\AM6018\\Zotero\\storage\\97K6PU5V\\Flynn et al. - 2021 - Symmetry kills the square in a multifunctional res.pdf","defaultPath":"files/43/Flynn et al. - 2021 - Symmetry kills the square in a multifunctional res.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653172021005,"version":0},"$loki":3},{"itemID":2,"item":{"key":"ZJ94E5K8","version":21,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multifunctionality in a reservoir computer","date":"2021-01","libraryCatalog":"aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org/doi/citedby/10.1063/5.0019974","accessDate":"2022-05-21T12:58:25Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"31","pages":"013125","publicationTitle":"Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science","DOI":"10.1063/5.0019974","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos","ISSN":"1054-1500","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Flynn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vassilios A.","lastName":"Tsachouridis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Amann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JVIPERLB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-21T12:58:25Z","dateModified":"2022-05-21T12:58:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/9513611/items/ZJ94E5K8","itemID":2,"attachments":[{"key":"MX2KE9BH","version":23,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://aip-scitation-org.ucc.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0019974","accessDate":"2022-05-21T12:58:30Z","parentItem":"ZJ94E5K8","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Flynn et al. - 2021 - Multifunctionality in a reservoir computer.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-21T12:58:30Z","dateModified":"2022-05-21T12:58:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/9513611/items/MX2KE9BH","localPath":"C:\\Users\\lekoi\\Documents\\AM6018\\Zotero\\storage\\MX2KE9BH\\Flynn et al. - 2021 - Multifunctionality in a reservoir computer.pdf","defaultPath":"files/44/Flynn et al. - 2021 - Multifunctionality in a reservoir computer.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653172021008,"version":0},"$loki":4},{"itemID":49,"item":{"key":"V9YAJS92","version":37,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Figure 2.

The collection of images are classified into three important anatomical landmarks and three clinically significant findings. In addition, it contains two categories of images related to endoscopic polyp removal. Sorting and annotation of the dataset is performed by medical doctors (experienced endoscopists).

A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually \"modernize\" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.","date":"2022-03-02","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545","accessDate":"2022-05-22T07:38:47Z","extra":"arXiv:2201.03545 [cs]\ntype:
